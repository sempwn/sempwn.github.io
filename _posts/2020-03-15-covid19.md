### Introduction

<p class="lead">
    To begin with a disclaimer, all simulations within this post are for educational
    purposes only. Although I have tried to use parameters consistent with the current
    covid-19 outbreak where possible, there are other factors such as incubation period,
    heterogeneity of the population, or importation of cases that I haven't explicitly
    included.
</p>

Among many of the things the current covid-19 pandemic has shown is the difficulty
in predicting whether an outbreak of an infectious disease will grow into an
epidemic and what might be the potential impact of subsequent interventions. Using models we
can build up a picture of what this uncertainty might be and factor in some elements
that we don't know about the disease such as if individuals can be asymptomatic carriers.

Another recent point of debate that's been particularly exemplified in the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/observer-view-on-the-government-coronavirus-strategy-must-face-scrutiny) is
around whether it is best to build up herd immunity or to impose strict
controls on movement early in the epidemic as has been done in [Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan](https://time.com/5802293/coronavirus-covid19-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan/). The apps below
will allow you to explore the impact of both intervention both early and later
in the epidemic.

### Outbreak control

We have to begin by defining the most important number in infectious disease
epidemiology, the $R_0$. It's full definition is,

<blockquote class="lead text-center">
    <p class="mb-0">The average number of secondary cases for every
        primary case in a completely susceptible population
    </p>
</blockquote>

This is a little technical, so let's break down each part of the definition.
A **completely susceptible population** is where all individuals are able to be
infected by the virus, where no one has any prior immunity. A **secondary case**
following a **primary case** is the number of individuals who are infected by one
individual. The **average number** is also important here. For example if an infection
has an $R_0$ of 2, on average an infected individual would infect 2 others, but this
could potentially be more or less.

At the start of an epidemic, many random infection events can make it incredibly
difficult to predict how many cases we would expect even a week later. To explore this,
the simulation below shows a series of infection events following one infected
individual (the technical name for this type of model is a branching process).
Using the slider you can change the reproduction number $R_0$ and simulate three generations
ahead (for this purpose we can assume a generation is 7 days, so we are simulating three
weeks ahead).

Early estimates of the $R_0$ for covid-19 are [around 2.5](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2820%2930144-4/fulltext) although there is a large
amount of uncertainty around this. Even if we did knew the $R_0$ exactly due to
the randomness with how infection events transpire we still see some scenarios
where there are a large number of cases after three generations and so where
there aren't any.

Now let's consider this process happening several times, where we keep simulating
what would transpire if one individual is infected. This builds up a
probability of an outbreak occurring and what would be the size of the outbreak.
Using the app below, you can change the initial $R_0$ and observe what the final
number of cases after three generations. As more simulations are run a pattern
begins to build up that describes the distribution of all possible infection
scenarios for that particular $R_0$.

Although I mentioned above that current estimates of the $R_0$ for covid-19 are
around 2.5, this is dependent on there being no intervention to its spread. Lots
of factors may help to limit the spread and reduce the $R_0$ including social distancing,
self-quarantining and contact tracing. Try reducing the $R_0$ above and see
how it impacts the probability of an outbreak occurring. You'll notice that if the
$R_0$ is below 1 then there is a zero probability of the epidemic taking off.

### Later epidemic case management

Many countries are now observing sustained community-based transmission where the
majority of new cases are from individuals becoming infected in their own community
and not individuals who had recently travelled abroad. In this situation outbreak
control is no longer feasible and so other measures must be used including encouraging
social distancing and hand washing. In more extreme cases countries, [such as Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italy_coronavirus_lockdown) have begun to impose national quarantines
for a given period.

Both the timing and duration of these interventions can be incredibly important
for controlling the total number of individuals who become infected, but also location and
height of the epidemic peak when the most individuals are infected in a given week. The idea is
to ["flatten the curve"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)
so as to not overwhelm a nation's healthcare services and give them more time to
respond.

The simulator below lets you explore the consequences of an intervention event where
the risk of transmission is reduced. The top-left graph shows the curve of the
epidemic where there is intervention and the counterfactual scenario where no intervention occurs.
The top-right shows the total number of infected individuals at the end of
an epidemic and those that had remained susceptible. The bottom graph below shows
the effective $R_0$ at a point in time, this is the average number of individuals
infected from a case in that moment. Try moving the $R_0$ slider below to see how
this impacts the size of the epidemic and its peak.

    </div>
</div>

The sliders above control how much the intervention reduces the spread of the infection,
where the start of the intervention occurs and its total duration. For this simulation
as soon as an intervention stops the $R_0$ returns to its initial value, which
depending on when the intervention starts can lead to the epidemic being delayed
or creating a double-peak epidemic. Also if the intervention begins too late after the
peak then there is little impact on the overall epidemic.


## Conclusions

As [Thomas House from Manchester University](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/thomas.house/blog/blog.html) has also commented on, initial interventions that lower the effective
reproduction may only be delaying those individuals from becoming infected, however
does reduce the peak of the epidemic. Many factors impact the overall epidemiology
of a virus and how that translates into the total cases infected. This is especially
problematic in the current pandemic where estimates of infectivity, incubation period,
and recovery time all have large uncertainty. Even more, it is not clear how much
these current or future interventions will impact the ability for covid-19 to spread.
